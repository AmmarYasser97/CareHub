# CareHub

CareHub Health Care System is a system that enables patients to accomplish three
tasks easily:
1. Find the right health provider to get treatment.
2. Retrieve medical records, such as test results and other health information.
3. Book appointments and scans easily with a button click.

Imagine the amount of effort thatâ€™ll be saved, all the hassle of looking for the right
doctor, and having to book appointments on ground, all this will be available from
home through this website.

All the needed information about the hospital will be available for the user.
