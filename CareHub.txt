//First video overview on project to get the concept
-This a health care system for hosipitals
-this how our website appears to ones who like to browse the internet and are not users
- they can browse to see our staff but they can not rate them without login.(stars are off)
-they can browse to see our clincs and our scans but they cannot book a reservation(no book button)
- they can login if they already have an account or sign up for new account
next videos we will show our actors in system
//second video showing actors and the role of receptionist and
 situation of one reserved at hosiptal offline with receptionist(guest) and
user(patient) reserves online from home with the same time slot
(so the system will ask one of them to choose another slot depending on who reserve first)
also this rules applies for 2 online users 

our actors that use the system are :
1-receptonist that reserve for guests offline at hosiptal(we have
for out system one receptionist account that we will give to the buyer of system
the buyer can add more receptionists by using superuser)
2-users(patients) our main users of system that have accounts and can reserve online
 and rate doctors
3-superuser that hold control of our system (add receptionists /add doctors /edit doctors
delete doctors/ add clinics/delete......) also it's user and can be patient one day and can reserve
clincs and be saved in its blog

now imagine a guest called Manar come to hosiptal and wants to book offline a heart clinic with 
magdy yagoob @ 2pm @7/7/2019 and Manar not a user doesn't have account 
let's see that in database and aslo we will login with receptionist account to book for her offline
and we will see that its reservation added to database and we will choose user patient in system 
and try to book the same slot . Manar is not user let's now see that its reservation saved in data base by login in it by superuser
as we see we have patient user called looda let's login with it and try to book same slot and see
what happens! so when booking same slot doesnt accept when booking another slot accept 
thanks!

//video 3 about patient users
let's know log in with looda as patient user and see what can we do !
this reservation was reserved last video
1-we can update its information
2- we can book reservations and saved in backlog as seen in last video
3-we can rate doctors now and for each patient there is a rate of doctor and overall rate of doctor
depend on number of patients that rated him/her(average rate) if we logged with another patient 
and rate same doctor it will take average rate but also we show rate of individual patient
let's see i don't rember let's create anew patient and rate from it this doctor
so rating comes from looda and new patient (4+3)/2=3.5 as average
Thanks keep watching!

//video 4 about super user
now one can wonder who add this doctors to website it's the admin the super user as another name
let's add another doctor to our website first we go to admin and enter superuser account
before adding let's see our staff
this our admin rofl alfy now our staff will increase by 1
also superuser can edit and delete doctors from its panel our website
also he/she can add clincs scans and delete them and edit them but clincs and scans from its panel
 Thanks I hope it was clear
